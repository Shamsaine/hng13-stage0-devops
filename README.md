This project is part of the HNG13 DevOps Stage 0 challenge. It demonstrates my ability to set up and manage a GitHub workflow, deploy an NGINX web server, and serve a custom webpage accessible over the internet. The goal is to simulate a real-world DevOps deployment process while ensuring proper documentation and server configuration.
